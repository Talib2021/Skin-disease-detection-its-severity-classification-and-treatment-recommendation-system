# Skin Disease Detection, Severity Classification, and Treatment Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive system designed to:

- Detect various **skin diseases** from images.
- Classify the **severity** of detected diseases (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).
- Provide **treatment recommendations** based on the diagnosis.

The model leverages deep learning techniques to achieve accurate detection and classification.

## Features

- **Multi-class Skin Disease Detection:** Recognizes multiple skin disease categories.
- **Severity Classification:** Assesses severity levels for specific diseases.
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Suggests appropriate treatment options based on predicted disease and severity.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Python-based app to run predictions easily.
